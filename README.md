# 🌐 WebMeet

WebMeet is a simple video calling web app built with **React.js** on the frontend and **Node.js + Socket.IO** on the backend.  
It’s my attempt to create a real-time communication tool that feels lightweight yet powerful.

## 💡 Why I Built This
I wanted to challenge myself with a real-time project that uses sockets.  
It took me quite some effort to understand how signaling and peer-to-peer calls work,  
but it was a fun and rewarding learning experience.
